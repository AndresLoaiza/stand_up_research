Featuring exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of the one-man show taking shape, the film follows John's riveting process - from his early inspirations and research, to his first-ever comedy club tour, through workshops of the show - before culminating in performances at the historic Public Theater as he aims for a Broadway run.
